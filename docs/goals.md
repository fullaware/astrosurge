I want find an asteroid, plan a mission to mine it and return the resources to Earth to sell.  Travel to the asteroid by changing ship.location day by day until it reaches the asteroid, mine_asteroid to remove element mass_kg from each element in an asteroid and deposit it in the ship.cargo, repeat until ship is at max ship.capacity.  Travel back to Earth changing ship.location until it reaches 0 which is Earth.  Then deposit the cargo into the mission.mined_elements list.  The mission will then sell_mined_elements and pay the user/company by incrementing their `user.bank` field.  

execute_mining_mission should only represent a single day when executed.  WIthin that day it will follow the mission plan of `travel to asteroid, mine, travel to earth`.  It will maintain the state of each day by incrementing the proper fields in the `mission.mission` document as well as the `ship` variables.  I should be able to execute_mining_mission over and over until the ship has completed the mission and it reports back "Mission Success" or "Mission Failure".  Mission Failure means the ship didn't make the trip because the `hull` is at 0 before reaching Earth at `location` 0. Please see the `docs/project_plan.md` for more details.
