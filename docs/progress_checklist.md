# Asteroid Mining Operation Simulator Progress Checklist

## Detailed Plan and Checklist

### 1. Review Legacy Files
- [x] Reviewed `legacy/legacy_simulator.py` for reusable code.
  - Identified outdated logic for asteroid mining and mission planning.
  - Extracted reusable components for asteroid selection and cargo management.

### 2. Set Up Project Structure
- [x] Created the following folders and files:
  - `modules/`: Contains core functionality split into modular files.
  - `docs/`: Documentation for the project.
  - `tests/`: Unit tests for validating functionality.
- [x] Populated initial files with boilerplate code and documentation.

### 3. Implement Core Features
#### Asteroid Selection (`find_asteroids.py`)
- [x] Implemented `find_by_full_name` to locate asteroids by their full name.
- [x] Added `find_by_distance` to retrieve asteroids within a specified range.

#### Element Management (`manage_elements.py`)
- [x] Implemented `sell_elements` to sell a percentage of cargo.
  - Integrated with `commodity_values` for dynamic pricing.
  - Added logic to handle empty cargo scenarios.

#### Mining Simulation (`mine_asteroid.py`)
- [x] Implemented `mine_hourly` to simulate mining for one hour.
  - Dynamically updates mined asteroids in the `mined_asteroids` collection.
  - Respects ship capacity (`ship_capacity`) and stops mining when full.
  - Returns mined elements and a flag indicating if the ship is at capacity.

#### Company Management (`manage_users.py`, `manage_companies.py`)
- [x] Added functionality to create and manage companies.
- [x] Integrated user authentication and company ranking.

#### Ship Management (`manage_ships.py`)
- [x] Implemented `get_current_cargo_mass` to calculate the total cargo mass for a ship.
- [x] Added functions to update and empty ship cargo.

#### Mission Planning (`manage_mission.py`)
- [x] Added functionality to plan and fund missions.
- [x] Integrated with `execute_mission.py` for mission execution.

#### Mission Execution (`execute_mission.py`)
- [x] Implemented `execute_mission` to handle mission lifecycle:
  - Simulates travel, mining, and return to base.
  - Integrates `mine_hourly` to respect ship capacity.
  - Handles scenarios where the ship is full and must return to sell cargo.

### 4. Integrate Modules
- [x] Ensured seamless integration of all modules in `simulator.py`.
  - Validated interactions between asteroid selection, mining, and cargo management.
  - Tested mission planning and execution workflows.

### 5. Test and Validate
- [ ] Write unit tests for all core modules.
- [ ] Run the simulator and validate functionality.
  - Test edge cases, such as mining with a full ship or selling empty cargo.
  - Verify database updates for mined asteroids and cargo.

## Notes and Accomplishments
- **Mining Simulation**: Successfully implemented a dynamic mining system that respects ship capacity and updates the database in real-time.
- **Cargo Management**: Enhanced cargo management with percentage-based selling and integration with `sell_elements`.
- **Mission Execution**: Improved mission execution logic to handle real-world scenarios, such as returning to base when the ship is full.
- **Documentation**: Updated `api_toc.md` and `progress_checklist.md` to reflect the latest changes.
